# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. We have been asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. To do so, we will preprocess the data for analysis, apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm to reduce the dimensions of the DataFrame, apply the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data, then finally visualize the distinct groups that correspond to our  principal components.

## Results

### Preprocessing the Data for PCA

* We read the crypto_data.csv file into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Original DataFrame had 1252 rows and 6 columns.

* All cyrptocurrencies that weren't being traded were removed.
* Only cryptocurrencies that had a working algorithm were kept.
* Rows with null values were removed.
* Only rows where cryptocurrency were mined were kept.
* "Coin Name" column was put into sepraate DataFrame and dropped from current one.
* preprocessed DataFrame had 532 rows and 5 columns.

* Text features in the DataFrame were converted to integers using get_dummies(), raising the column count from 5 to 98.
* Data was standardized using StandardScaler(). 
* The above array is the first object in the DataFrame, as the 98 entries correspond to the 98 coulmns.

### Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces our dimensions from 98 to 3.
