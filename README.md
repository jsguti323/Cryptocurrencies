# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. We have been asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. To do so, we will preprocess the data for analysis, apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm to reduce the dimensions of the DataFrame, apply the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data, then finally visualize the distinct groups that correspond to our  principal components.
